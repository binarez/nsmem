Experimental C++ memory allocation library.

// Looking for collaborators. Some of the code is bad because I worked on it over many years and it's a library for experimenting. It works pretty good but some of the allocators are incomplete or untested. The bad code is not too big, I will refactor it eventually.

# nsmem
{
namespace mem
  // C++ memory management library

  - Multiple allocators
  - Polymorphic allocator
  - Fences
  - Logging 
  - Leak detection
}
