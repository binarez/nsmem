namespace mem { C++ memory management library }

An experimental C++ memory allocation library.

// Looking for collaborators. Some of the code is bad because I worked on it over many years and it's a library for experimenting. It works pretty good but some of the allocators are incomplete or untested. The bad code is not too big, I will refactor it eventually.

# nsmem
  - Multiple allocators
