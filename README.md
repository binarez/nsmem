// TODO : finish this damn library. Looking for collaborators. Some of the code is crap because I worked on it over many years. It works pretty good but some of the allocators are incomplete or untested. The crap code is not too big, I will refactor it.

# nsmem
namespace mem
{
  // C++ memory management library

  - Multiple allocators
  - Polymorphic allocator
  - Fences
  - Logging 
  - Leak detection
}
