I am in the process of importing this library into GitHub. I worked on this lib a while ago, it has been sleeping on my hard drive for the last few years. This is an experiment. I plan on making it stable and pretty. My style evolved over the years and some of the code in this library I do not like. I don't have much time to contribute to it, I'm accepting PR into this project.

# nsmem
namespace mem { C++ memory management library }
